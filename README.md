# Database Workshop: PostgreSQL in Docker üóÑÔ∏èüêã

Welcome to the **Database Workshop** project! This repository contains the summary and resources from a hands-on workshop that covers the end-to-end process of designing, building, and interacting with a **PostgreSQL** database inside a Docker container using **dpage/pgadmin4**.

In this workshop, we will explore everything from creating an **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** to writing **SQL queries**, creating **stored procedures**, defining **views**, and working with **tables**.

---

## üßë‚Äçüè´ Workshop Summary

The goal of this workshop is to introduce key database concepts and provide hands-on practice in a controlled, containerized environment using PostgreSQL within Docker.

### Key Concepts Covered:

1. **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**:
   - Designed an ERD to model relationships and entities for the database structure.
   - Focused on normalizing the database and ensuring the schema was optimized for scalability.

2. **PostgreSQL with Docker**:
   - Set up a Docker container to run the **PostgreSQL Database**.
   - Configured database connections and managed data persistence within the containerized environment.

3. **Creating Tables**:
   - Translated the ERD into actual tables, defining columns, data types, primary keys, and foreign keys.
   - Utilized SQL commands for table creation.

4. **Generating Sample Data**:
   - Generated sample data to simulate real-world scenarios using **SQL Insert Statements**.
   - Used Python scripts and imported CSV files (generated by public internet sites) to automate bulk data insertion for large datasets.

5. **Writing SQL Queries**:
   - Practiced writing **SELECT**, **JOIN**, **GROUP BY**, and **ORDER BY** queries.
   - Learned best practices for querying data efficiently, including indexing and optimization techniques.

6. **Writing DML Statements**:
   - Practiced writing **UPDATE**, **DELETE**, and **ALTER** statements.
   - Learned best practices for managing data efficiently, including indexing and optimization techniques.

7. **Views**:
   - Created **views** to simplify complex queries and provide data abstraction.
   - Focused on security by limiting user access to certain columns or rows.

8. **Stored Procedures and Functions**:
   - Created reusable **stored procedures** and **functions** to handle common database tasks.
   - Used SQL to manage repetitive operations and ensure better performance.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Docker (for running the container)
- A terminal or command prompt
- Basic knowledge of SQL and databases
- PostgreSQL Docker image (available via Docker Hub)

### Setting Up the Docker Container

To run PostgreSQL in a Docker container, follow these steps:

1. **Pull the Docker Images**:
    ```bash
    docker pull postgres:latest
    docker pull dpage/pgadmin4:latest
    ```

2. **Run the Docker Container**:
    ```bash
    docker run --name postgres -d -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password postgres:latest
    ```

3. **Access the Container**:
    ```bash
    docker exec -it postgres bash
    ```

4. **Start the Database Client**:
    - You can now connect to the PostgreSQL database inside the container using `psql` or a database client of your choice.

Ah, I see! You haven't included instructions on how to run and access the PostgreSQL database through **pgAdmin**, which is a crucial part of the workshop. Let me help you add that section to your README. Here's how you can explain it clearly:

## Accessing PostgreSQL via pgAdmin

Once you have set up the PostgreSQL and pgAdmin containers, you can use **pgAdmin** to manage and interact with your database. Below are the steps to access the database through pgAdmin.

### 1. **Run the pgAdmin Container**
   - Start the pgAdmin container alongside your PostgreSQL container.
   - Use the following command to run pgAdmin:

     ```bash
     docker run --name pgadmin -d -p 8080:80 -e PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=admin@example.com -e PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=admin dpage/pgadmin4:latest
     ```

   - Replace `admin@example.com` and `admin` with your preferred email and password for pgAdmin.

### 2. **Access pgAdmin in Your Browser**
   - Open your web browser and navigate to:
     ```
     http://localhost:8080
     ```
   - Log in using the email and password you set in the previous step.

### 3. **Connect to the PostgreSQL Database**
   - After logging in, follow these steps to connect to your PostgreSQL database:
     1. Click on **Add New Server**.
     2. In the **General** tab, provide a name for your server (e.g., `PostgreSQL Docker`).
     3. In the **Connection** tab, enter the following details:
        - **Host name/address**: `postgres` (or the name of your PostgreSQL container).
        - **Port**: `5432` (default PostgreSQL port).
        - **Maintenance database**: `postgres` (default database).
        - **Username**: `postgres` (default superuser).
        - **Password**: The password you set for the PostgreSQL container (e.g., `your_password`).
     4. Click **Save** to connect.

### 4. **Explore and Manage the Database**
   - Once connected, you can:
     - Create and manage databases.
     - Run SQL queries using the **Query Tool**.
     - View and edit tables, views, and stored procedures.
     - Monitor database activity and performance.

---

### Example: Running a Query in pgAdmin
1. Expand the server you just added.
2. Right-click on a database (e.g., `postgres`) and select **Query Tool**.
3. Write and execute SQL queries. For example:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM your_table;
   ```

4. View the results in the **Data Output** tab.

---

### Troubleshooting
- **Connection Issues**:
  - Ensure both the PostgreSQL and pgAdmin containers are running.
  - Verify the container names and network settings (e.g., use `docker network` if containers are on different networks).
  - Check the logs for errors:
    ```bash
    docker logs postgres
    docker logs pgadmin
    ```

- **Forgot Password**:
  - If you forget the pgAdmin password, you can reset it by restarting the container with a new `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD`.
