# Database Workshop: PostgreSQL in Docker üóÑÔ∏èüêã

Welcome to the **Database Workshop** project! This repository contains the summary and resources from a hands-on workshop that covers the end-to-end process of designing, building, and interacting with a **PostgreSQL** database inside a Docker container using **dpage/pgadmin4**.

In this workshop, we will explore everything from creating an **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** to writing **SQL queries**, creating **stored procedures**, defining **views**, and working with **tables**.

---

## üßë‚Äçüè´ Workshop Summary

The goal of this workshop is to introduce key database concepts and provide hands-on practice in a controlled, containerized environment using PostgreSQL within Docker.

### Key Concepts Covered:

1. **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**:
   - Designed an ERD to model relationships and entities for the database structure.
   - Focused on normalizing the database and ensuring the schema was optimized for scalability.

2. **PostgreSQL with Docker**:
   - Set up a Docker container to run the **PostgreSQL Database**.
   - Configured database connections and managed data persistence within the containerized environment.

3. **Creating Tables**:
   - Translated the ERD into actual tables, defining columns, data types, primary keys, and foreign keys.
   - Utilized SQL commands for table creation.

4. **Generating Sample Data**:
   - Generated sample data to simulate real-world scenarios using **SQL Insert Statements**.
   - Used Python scripts and imported CSV files (generated by public internet sites) to automate bulk data insertion for large datasets.

5. **Writing SQL Queries**:
   - Practiced writing **SELECT**, **JOIN**, **GROUP BY**, and **ORDER BY** queries.
   - Learned best practices for querying data efficiently, including indexing and optimization techniques.

6. **Writing DML Statements**:
   - Practiced writing **UPDATE**, **DELETE**, and **ALTER** statements.
   - Learned best practices for managing data efficiently, including indexing and optimization techniques.

7. **Views**:
   - Created **views** to simplify complex queries and provide data abstraction.
   - Focused on security by limiting user access to certain columns or rows.

8. **Stored Procedures and Functions**:
   - Created reusable **stored procedures** and **functions** to handle common database tasks.
   - Used SQL to manage repetitive operations and ensure better performance.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Docker (for running the container)
- A terminal or command prompt
- Basic knowledge of SQL and databases
- PostgreSQL Docker image (available via Docker Hub)

### Setting Up the Docker Container

To run PostgreSQL in a Docker container, follow these steps:

1. **Pull the Docker Images**:
    ```bash
    docker pull postgres:latest
    docker pull dpage/pgadmin4:latest
    ```

2. **Run the Docker Container**:
    ```bash
    docker run --name postgres -d -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password postgres:latest
    ```

3. **Access the Container**:
    ```bash
    docker exec -it postgres bash
    ```

4. **Start the Database Client**:
    - You can now connect to the PostgreSQL database inside the container using `psql` or a database client of your choice.

## üí° Workshop Outcomes

By the end of this workshop, you should be able to:

- Design and create a database schema based on an ERD.
- Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with SQL.
- Write complex queries using joins, aggregations, and subqueries.
- Create and use stored functions and procedures for automation and performance.
- Work effectively with PostgreSQL inside a Docker container for development and testing.
